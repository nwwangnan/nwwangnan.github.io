I'm a third-year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/">Prof. Chris Re</a> and affiliated with the Stanford AI Lab & Statistical Machine Learning Group.
I'm broadly interested in accelerating the pace at which machine learning can be robustly and safely used in practice, whether in academic and research settings, or industry at large.

I've been fortunate to have been advised by brilliant mentors past and present, among them <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/">Prof. Emma Brunskill</a>, <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/">Prof. Fei-Fei Li</a>, <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/">Prof. Jure Leskovec</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/sidhartha-sinha">Dr. Sidhartha Sinha</a> at Stanford, <a href="http://data-people.cs.illinois.edu/">Prof. Aditya Parameswaran</a> and <a href="http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/">Prof. Hari Sundaram</a> at UIUC and <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mausam/">Prof. Mausam</a> at IIT-Delhi. I'm grateful to them
for their advice and support through the years.

Prior to my time at Stanford, I graduated with a Master's degree from the Department of Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018, where I was a recipient of the Siebel Scholarship in 2018. In my undergrad, I majored in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi (IITD).
