Welcome to my personal website! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UTSA, supervised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/">Prof. James Bray</a> and affiliated with the family health psychology lab. I am broadly interested in improving the accuracy at which different statistical and psychometric models can be robustly and safely used to improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning whether in academic and research setting, or industy at large.

I've been fortunate to have been advised by brilliant mentors past and present, among them <a href="http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/mevans/">Prof. Mark Evans</a>, <a href="https://education.wsu.edu/olusola-adesope/">Prof. Prof. Olusola Adesope</a> at WSU, <a href="https://education.fsu.edu/faculty-and-staff/dr-russell-almond/">Prof. Russell Almond</a> and <a href="https://education.fsu.edu/faculty-and-staff/dr-yanyun-yang/">Prof. Yanyun Yang</a> at FSU. I'm grateful to them for their advice and support through the years.

Prior to my postdoctoral work, I earned my Ph.D in the program of measurement and statistics at Florida State University in 2019 and graduated with a Master's degree from the Department of Educational Psychology at Washington State University.
